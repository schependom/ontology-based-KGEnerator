Be critical about my current implementation. Does it align with my thesis goals?



The KGenerator class should house the main data generation logic. The create_data.py file should be the main train/test split creator, and it should call the logic in the KGenerator (generate.py) to do so. The NegativeSampler should handle all sampling logic.



When running generate.py on a small toy dataset, it should export all proof trees so that I can visualize verify that it's using all possible paths of deduction. 

 







Remove the duplicate negative sampling logic from generate.py



Refactor the codebase to meet the requirements above



Keep all comments that are still relevant



Remove unnecessary verbose print statements, only print when hitting errors, or important generation milestones, like no possible proofs for a rule, etc
